# ToeRings

A theme-able system monitoring tool.

![examples](./public/example-all.png)

I tried to port the [Seamod](https://github.com/maxiwell/conky-seamod) Conky theme to Tauri.
I copied a lot of the Rust code from [Bottom](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom).

The name "ToeRings" just sounds like Tauri, and contains the word "rings".

## Run in Development

```sh
npm i
npm run tauri dev
```
